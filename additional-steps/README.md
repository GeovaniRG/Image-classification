# Here are a few additional things you could consider adding to your image classification project:

1. Data augmentation: This is a technique to artificially increase the size of your dataset by applying random transformations to the images. This can help to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of your model.

2. Ensemble methods: You can use ensemble methods like bagging and boosting to improve the performance of your model by combining the predictions of multiple models.

3. Transfer learning: Instead of using a pre-trained model from scratch, you can use transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained model on a similar dataset. This can help to improve the performance of your model by leveraging the knowledge learned from a related task.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: You can use techniques such as grid search or random search to find the best values for the hyperparameters of your model.

5. Model visualization: You can use techniques like saliency maps and activations maps to visualize the features that the model is using to make predictions.

6. Monitor and debug the model: You can use tools like TensorBoard to monitor the performance of your model and detect any issues or bugs.
