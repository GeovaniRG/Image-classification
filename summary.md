# Here is a summary of the steps you should follow:

1. Collect and prepare a dataset of images
2. Load a pre-trained model (such as VGG16)
3. Remove the last fully connected layer and add new layers appropriate for your dataset
4. Freeze the convolutional layers of the pre-trained model
5. Compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics
6. Train the model on your dataset
7. Evaluate the performance of the model on a test set
8. Use the trained model to make predictions on new images
